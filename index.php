				<div class="firstPostContent">
					<p>Life at Marist outside the classroom offers a wealth of
						opportunity for personal growth and development that supports and
						enhances students' academic experience. From exciting trips to
						Broadway shows, to volunteering at a local elementary school or
						food pantry, getting a massage at the annual Wellness Fair,
						attending a workshop on stress management in a residence hall, or
						participating with hundreds of fellow students in the Relay for
						Life, there are countless activities from which to choose.</p>
					<p>Consistent with the Marist College Mission , the sense of
						community and the sense of service to others are important to us.
						Both the philosophy and the staff in the Division of Student
						Affairs support the development of the whole person:
						intellectually, socially, physically and spiritually. In addition
						to making lifelong friendships with one another, students have
						contact with many staff and faculty in both formal and informal
						settings. Our programs and services are designed to promote
						self-discovery, leadership development, healthy behaviors and
						social responsibility as well as enjoyment.</p>
